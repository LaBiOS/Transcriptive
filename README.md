# Transcriptive

Transcriptive is a bioinformatics analysis pipeline used for RNA sequencing data. The workflow processes raw data from FastQ inputs, aligns the reads, generates gene and transcript counts,  and performs extensive quality-control on the results. 

The pipeline is still in **alpha version** and some steps need to be performed manually through the web pages of the CPC2, CPAT, CNCI and CPPRED tools.

The pipeline was built using Docker, allowing it to run across multiple computing infrastructures in a very portable way. In addition, it is configured in a Galaxy environment with its main dependencies.
